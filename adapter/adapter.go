// Deliverer is implemented by adapters that deliver events one at a time.
// Adapters implementing Deliverer get the middleware stack (retry, circuit
// breaker, rate limiting, DLQ, metrics, tracing, ack) for free. The middleware
// provides the Start() event loop — Deliverer adapters should still implement
// Start() as a fallback but the pipeline will prefer the middleware path.
type Deliverer interface {
	Deliver(ctx context.Context, ev event.Event) error

// AckFunc is called by an adapter after it has fully processed an event.
// The lsn argument is the WAL position of the event (event.Event.LSN).
// Adapters must only call this when they are done with the event and do not
// need it again (successful delivery, DLQ record, or intentional skip).
type AckFunc func(lsn uint64)

// Acknowledger is implemented by adapters that support cooperative
// checkpointing. The pipeline injects an AckFunc via SetAckFunc when
// cooperative checkpointing is enabled. Advanced — only needed when adapters
// must control exactly when WAL positions are acknowledged.
type Acknowledger interface {

// Validator is implemented by adapters that can verify their external
// dependencies (e.g. DNS resolution, connectivity, bucket existence) before
// the pipeline starts. Pipeline calls Validate() after construction; failures
// abort startup unless --skip-validation is set.
type Validator interface {

// Drainer is implemented by adapters that need to flush in-flight work during
// graceful shutdown. Pipeline calls Drain() after the errgroup returns, with a
// context bounded by shutdown_timeout.

// HTTPMountable is optionally implemented by adapters that serve HTTP routes
// (e.g., graphql, duckdb). The pipeline mounts their routes on the shared HTTP server.

// Batcher is implemented by adapters that accumulate events and flush them
// in batches (e.g., S3, search). The batch runner provides the event loop,
// timer/size flush triggers, shutdown drain, DLQ, and cooperative ack.
