// Deliverer is implemented by adapters that deliver events one at a time.
// Adapters implementing Deliverer get the middleware stack (retry, circuit
// breaker, rate limiting, DLQ, metrics, tracing, ack) for free. The middleware
// provides the Start() event loop — Deliverer adapters should still implement
// Start() as a fallback but the pipeline will prefer the middleware path.
type Deliverer interface {

// AckFunc is called by an adapter after it has fully processed an event.
// The lsn argument is the WAL position of the event (event.Event.LSN).
// Adapters must only call this when they are done with the event and do not
// need it again (successful delivery, DLQ record, or intentional skip).

// checkpointing. Following the DLQAware pattern, the pipeline injects an
// AckFunc via SetAckFunc when cooperative checkpointing is enabled.

// Traceable is implemented by adapters that support OpenTelemetry tracing.
// The pipeline injects a tracer when tracing is enabled.

// Validator is implemented by adapters that can verify their external
// dependencies (e.g. DNS resolution, connectivity, bucket existence) before
// the pipeline starts. Pipeline calls Validate() after construction; failures
// abort startup unless --skip-validation is set.
type Validator interface {

// Drainer is implemented by adapters that need to flush in-flight work during
// graceful shutdown. Pipeline calls Drain() after the errgroup returns, with a
// context bounded by shutdown_timeout.
type Drainer interface {

// Reinjector is implemented by adapters that produce events back into the bus
// (e.g. the view adapter emits VIEW_RESULT events). The pipeline injects the
// bus ingest channel before starting adapters.

// Batcher is implemented by adapters that accumulate events and flush them
// in batches (e.g., S3, search). The batch runner provides the event loop,
// timer/size flush triggers, shutdown drain, DLQ, and cooperative ack.
